# MIPS32_Compiler
Introduction
------------

This is an assembler that takes a MIPS instruction (written in assembly) and turns it into machine code. The output file type is a .txt type but can be saved as a .mif using any text editor to be used with RAM.

How to Use
----------

The format that the instruction should be written is can be found in any MIPS ISA reference page. I included a sample file called Input.txt to demonstrate the format of the instructions.

Compile and Run the program, the terminal will ask for a file name, enter your instruction file and include ".txt" extension. The terminal prints out some information but will say "file assembly completed" when it is finished and succesful. Go to the project directory and find the file called Output.txt.

PLEASE READ:
* The assembler does not take upper case hexadecimal values.
